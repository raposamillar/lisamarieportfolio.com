# Design Portfolio

## Hi, Iâ€™m Lisa, a research-driven designer with a background in classical piano, performance, and creative teaching.

This portfolio showcases RunScape, a mobile app prototype I designed using Figma, as well as some recent samples of my freelance web design work for clients in the music and travel industries. To show my level of proficiency in JavaScript, I've embedded a link to an in-progress project on GitHub featuring a composer's music catalogue. The link to a video trailer I created for a collaborative music/arts event in Toronto is the final piece.</br></br>
If there is anything you should know about my work style, it's that while I am creative, I'm also highly practical. And neat. That means, I don't just create. I make sure that files are named according to set conventions. I keep in mind what is best for the company, client, customers, and product. Similarly, like many designers I've mindfully adapted the use of AI tools into my workflow. I believe in using technology to enhance creativity, not replace it.
