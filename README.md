# Design Portfolio

## Hi, I’m Lisa — a research-driven product designer with a background in classical piano, performance, and creative teaching.
For over two decades, I’ve helped learners thrive through thoughtful problem-solving and human connection. That same mindset shapes my approach to design today: empathetic, curious, and collaborative. I care about the details that make tools feel not just functional, but meaningful.
Recently, I designed a mobile app for a local running community and improved a piano technician’s website — combining user research, interaction design, and frontend skills to bring ideas to life.
I’m especially drawn to projects that blend wellness, creativity, and technology, and I’m always looking for ways to make digital experiences feel more human.
